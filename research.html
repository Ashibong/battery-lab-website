      <b>Lithium-ion Battery Analysis</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This study focuses on the comprehensive analysis of commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) through both electrochemical characterization and internal material investigations. In particular, degraded cells subjected to charge–discharge cycling were examined using advanced analytical techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These methods enabled systematic identification of microstructural and compositional changes in electrodes and materials, thereby providing critical insights into the degradation mechanisms of LIBs. By correlating electrochemical performance deterioration with physicochemical property changes, reliable diagnostic indicators of cell degradation are established. The outcomes of this research are expected to serve as a valuable foundation for lifetime prediction and performance improvement strategies, ultimately contributing to the development of safe and high-reliability energy storage systems.

      <b>AI-based SOH Estimation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This study develops an AI-based framework for the accurate estimation of the state of health (SoH) in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). A comprehensive database reflecting real-world operating conditions, including variations in temperature, charge/discharge profiles, and usage history, was constructed. The dataset was divided into training and validation sets, and machine learning algorithms were employed to capture nonlinear degradation patterns. The proposed model effectively accounts for current, voltage, and state-of-charge (SoC) conditions, and its predictive performance was evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE) metrics. Moreover, full-cycle SoH estimation was performed and validated against experimental ground truths, confirming the reliability of the model. The findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can contribute to the development of precise diagnostic tools for enhancing battery performance and safety, and can be further applied to the design of high-reliability battery management systems (BMS) and next-generation energy storage technologies.

      <b>Battery Degradation Modeling</b>

    <p>
      We develop accelerated degradation modeling frameworks for lithium-ion batteries that couple electrochemical and side reaction mechanisms. These frameworks capture SEI growth, transition-metal dissolution, solvent oxidation, and salt decomposition, among other mechanisms, enabling the prediction of long-term aging with reduced computational cost. Through advanced acceleration strategies, our approach maintains accuracy while significantly reducing simulation time, allowing efficient evaluation of cell- and system-level performance.

      <b>Lithium Metal Batteries Dendrite Simulation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Lithium(Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are considered promising candidates for next-generation energy storage systems owing to their exceptionally high theoretical capacity and low electrochemical potential. However, the uncontrolled growth of Li dendrites remains a critical challenge, leading to severe safety risks and shortened cycle life. 
      In this study, a simulation-based model was developed to observe and investigate dendrite growth in lithium metal batteries. The model enables analysis of dendrite behavior under various operating conditions, such as current and voltage, and is employed to identify strategies for suppressing Li dendrite formation. The findings provide fundamental insights into enhancing the performance and safety of LMBs and can serve as a basis for establishing design and control strategies for next-generation high–energy-density batteries.

      <b>Inactive Lithium Formation and Accumulation in Li-Metal Batteries</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Lithium metal anodes provide high energy density but inevitably suffer from the growth of inactive lithium layers during cycling. This inactive Li (dead Li) formation, often accompanied by dendrite growth, causes voltage polarization, capacity fade, and mechanical swelling in the cell. The generation of dead Li and dendrites is driven by non-uniform ion transport, local current density fluctuations, and electrolyte wetting inhomogeneity. To address this, we developed an electrochemical–mechanical coupled model that accounts for inactive Li layer porosity, thickness evolution, and SEI formation, linking them directly to stress and pressure development. Ultimately, by identifying and quantifying the factors that accelerate or slow down inactive Li growth, our research aims to improve the Coulombic efficiency and long-term stability of lithium metal batteries.

      <b>Battery Thermal Runaway & Propagation Simulation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The aim is to deeply elucidate and predict the phenomenon of thermal runaway (TR)—a critical safety issue in lithium-ion batteries—and its propagation mechanisms. A high-precision simulation model will be established to observe the entire process, from initiation to propagation of thermal runaway, within a virtual environment. This allows for the quantitative analysis of the physical and chemical characteristics at each stage. Ultimately, this study seeks to provide essential predictive technologies for battery system design and the establishment of safety standards, thereby contributing to a significant improvement in battery safety.    </p>

    <p>
      We study a BMS topology that embeds COMSOL’s physics-based battery model directly into a Simulink circuit, so that electrochemical and thermal state changes (e.g., lithium stoichiometry, side-reaction heat, SEI growth, parameter fade) feed the controller in real time. The co-simulation lets the BMS make decisions—balancing, derating, protection—using physico-chemical truth rather than lumped surrogates, enabling precise prediction of pack heat generation and cell degradation under realistic drive cycles and control actions.
